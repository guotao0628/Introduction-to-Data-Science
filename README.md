# Biography

&emsp; Rafael A. Irizarry is professor of data sciences at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, professor
of biostatistics at Harvard, and a fellow of the American Statistical Association. Dr. Irizarry 
is an applied statistician and during the last 20 years has worked in diverse areas, including 
genomics, sound engineering, and public health. He disseminates solutions to data analysis challenges
as open source software, tools that are widely downloaded and used. Prof. Irizarry has also developed
and taught several data science courses at Harvard as well as popular online courses.

# Reviews

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   &emsp;  "I think the book would be perfect for schools looking to make a transition to a model where
    introduction to data science takes the place of introduction to statistics and maybe introductory
    computer science." ~Arend Kuyper, Northwestern University

   &emsp;  "A great introduction to data science and modern R programing, with tons of examples of application
    of the R abilities throughout the whole volume. The book suggests multiple links to the internet
    websites related to the topics under consideration that makes it an incredibly useful source of
    contemporary data science and programing, helping to students and researchers in their projects."
    ~Technometrics

   &emsp;  "Introduction to Data Science will teach you to juggle with your data and get maximum results from
    it using R. I highly recommended this book for students and everybody taking the first steps in data
    science using R." ~ Maria Ivanchuk, ISCB News

# Book Description

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&emsp; Introduction to Data Science: Data Analysis and Prediction Algorithms with R introduces concepts and skills 
that can help you tackle real-world data analysis challenges. It covers concepts from probability, statistical 
inference, linear regression, and machine learning. It also helps you develop skills such as R programming, data 
wrangling, data visualization, predictive algorithm building, file organization with UNIX/Linux shell, version 
control with Git and GitHub, and reproducible document preparation.

&emsp; This book is a textbook for a first course in data science. No previous knowledge of R is necessary, 
although some experience with programming may be helpful. The book is divided into six parts: R, data 
visualization, statistics with R, data wrangling, machine learning, and productivity tools. Each part
has several chapters meant to be presented as one lecture.

&emsp; The author uses motivating case studies that realistically mimic a data scientist’s experience.
He starts by asking specific questions and answers these through data analysis so concepts are 
learned as a means to answering the questions. Examples of the case studies included are: US 
murder rates by state, self-reported student heights, trends in world health and economics, the
impact of vaccines on infectious disease rates, the financial crisis of 2007-2008, election 
forecasting, building a baseball team, image processing of hand-written digits, and movie 
recommendation systems.

&emsp; The statistical concepts used to answer the case study questions are only briefly introduced, 
so complementing with a probability and statistics textbook is highly recommended for in-depth
understanding of these concepts. If you read and understand the chapters and complete the 
exercises, you will be prepared to learn the more advanced concepts and skills needed to become an expert.

&emsp; A complete solutions manual is available to registered instructors who require the text for a course.
